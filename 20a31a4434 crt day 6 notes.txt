I.EXCEPTION HANDLING:- In general, when a Python script encounters a situa-
  ------------------  -tion that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. 
  An exception is a Python object that represents an error. When a Python  
  script raises an exception, it must either handle the exception immedia-
  -tely otherwise it terminates and quits.
 •When there is exception the developer does not want interuption or disturb-
  -ance in the program flow  to control these we are using exception handle-
  -ing.
 •The cause of an exception is often external to the program itself. For 
  example, an incorrect input, a malfunctioning IO device etc. Because the 
  program abruptly terminates on encountering an exception, it may cause 
  damage to system resources, such as files. Hence, the exceptions should 
  be properly handled so that an abrupt termination of the program is 
  prevented.
 •Python uses 'try' and 'except' keywords to handle exceptions.Both keywords
  are followed by indented blocks.
  
Syntax:-
------
try :
    #statements in try block
except :
    #executed when error in try block


 •There are mainly three kinds of distinguishable errors in Python: syntax 
  errors, exceptions and logical errors.

II.OOP's:-(Object Oriented programming):- It is a effiecient concept,used in
   ------------------------------------   all object oriented language like
   java and python, for multiple reasons we use OOP's concepts
   for example:-code reusability,data security,hiding data.
   
   Class:- It is a blueprint. E.g.:birds,laptops.
   Objects:- It is a thing created based on class.
           NOTE:- one class can have multiple objects.
   
   EXAMPLES:-
   class:-birds
   object:-parrots,pegions,sparrow etc
 
   class:-laptop
   object:-lenovo,mac,hp,dell,etc 

•In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm 
 that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-
 world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the 
 programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions
 that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the 
 code can access this data.

 ->Objects
 ->Polymorphism
 ->Encapsulation
