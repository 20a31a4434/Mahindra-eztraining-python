CRT PHASE-II DAY-2 NOTES:-
------------------------
====================================================================================
I.PRIVATE and PRIVATE encap FUNCTIONS:-
  -----------------------------------
  1.public:-The public member is accessible from inside or outside the class.
    ------

  2.private:-The private member is accessible only inside class. Define a private 
    -------   member by prefixing the member name with two underscores.
   syntax:-__a  (double underscore__variable name)
====================================================================================
II.POLYMORPHISM:-Polymorphism in python defines methods in the child class that have 
   ------------  the same name as the methods in the parent class. In inheritance, 
                 the child class inherits the methods from the parent class. Also, 
                 it is possible to modify a method in a child class that it has 
                 inherited from the parent class 
  types in polymorphism:- 

          1.overloading:- Method Overloading in Python is a type of Compile-time 
            -----------   Polymorphism using which we can define two or more metho-
                          -ds in the same class with the same name but with a 
                          different parameter list. We cannot perform method 
                          overloading in the Python programming language as every-
                          -thing is considered an object in Python.
            there are two types in method overloading they are:-

            a.operator overloading:- Operator Overloading means giving extended 
              --------------------   meaning beyond their predefined operational 
                                     meaning. For example operator + is used to add
                                     two integers as well as join two strings and 
                                     merge two lists. It is achievable because '+' 
                                     operator is overloaded by int class and str 
                                     class.

            b.method overloading:- Methods in Python can be called with zero, one, 
              ------------------   or more parameters. This process of calling the 
                                   same method in different ways is called method 
                                   overloading.

          2.overridding:- Method overriding is a feature of object-oriented progra-
            -----------   -mming languages where the subclass or child class can 
                          provide the program with specific characteristics or a 
                          specific implementation process of data provided that are
                          already defined in the parent class or superclass.
                              (OR)
                  If a method is defective or cannot be used inside derived class 
                  it will take it from its base class or parent class.

                                   DATA STRUCTURES
                                   ===============
The basic Python data structures in Python include list, set, tuples, and dictionary. 
Each of the data structures is unique in its own way. Data structures are “containers”
that organize and group data according to type. The data structures differ based on 
mutability and order. (OR) Helps to write efficient programs.

CLASSIFICATION OF DATA STRUCTURES:-
---------------------------------  
Data structure has many different uses in our daily life. There are many different data 
structures that are used to solve different mathematical and logical problems. By using 
data structure, one can organize and process a very large amount of data in a relatively 
short period.
                             

                            DATA STRUCTURES

    |                                                                |
  Linear                                                      Non-Linear

   |                 |                             |                    |

1.Linear data structure:- Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially 
 ---------------------   or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and
                         next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. 
 Examples of linear data structures are array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.
 there are two types in linear datastructures they are:-
  •Static data structure:-Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to 
   ---------------------  access the elements in a static data structure. 
   An example of this data structure is an array.

  •Dynamic data structure:-In the dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be 
   ----------------------  randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered 
                           efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code. 
   Examples of this data structure are queue, stack, etc.

2.Non-linear data structure:-Data structures where data elements are not placed sequenti-
  -------------------------  -ally or linearly are called non-linear data structures. In 
                             a non-linear data structure, we can’t traverse all the 
                             elements in a single run only. 
  Examples of non-linear data structures are trees and graphs.

===========================================================================================
III.LINKED LIST:-As the name says list of items which are linked with one another is called 
    -----------  linked list.
                 Real time example is train
Types of linked lists:-  
--------------------- 
1.Single linked list:-
2.double linked list
3.circular linked list

CREATING LINKED LIST:-
--------------------
step-1:-create the node
step-2:-partition the node with two segments i.e. 'data' and 'none'
step-3:-add value into the blank node
step-4:-mark the node as head
step-5:-creating next node by following the above steps
step-6:-establish link b/w first and second nodes

DISPLAYING LINKED LIST:-
----------------------
Traversel is required from first node till tail node inorder to display exsiting linked 
list.
